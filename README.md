# Adobe-Sign-Data-Validation

This is a visualforce page that can site between your salesforce button and the adobe sign (formerly echosign) agreement page.
It utilises a formula to check if enough data has been entered in order to send the agreement. Note: you will need to create this formula field in your own org.

A full breakdown of the code is available here:
